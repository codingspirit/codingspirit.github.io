There are some Yocto distributions still using sysvinit as their default init manager. To replace it with systemd, some modifications need to be done in **local.conf**:

<!--more-->

```conf
# build/conf/local.conf
DISTRO_FEATURES_append = " systemd"
VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_init_manager = "systemd"
DISTRO_FEATURES_BACKFILL_CONSIDERED += "sysvinit"
VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_initscripts = ""
```
